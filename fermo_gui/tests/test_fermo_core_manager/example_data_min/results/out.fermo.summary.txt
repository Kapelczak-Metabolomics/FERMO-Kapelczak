Molecular feature and sample information was parsed from the file 'quant_all.csv' in the format 'mzmine3' with 'positive' ion mode polarity.
MS/MS fragmentation information was parsed from the file 'msms.mgf' in the format 'mgf'. MS/MS fragments +- 10 mass units around precursor m/z were removed.
MS/MS fragments with an intensity less than '0.01' relative to the base peak were removed.
Molecular features were filtered and only retained if they were inside the relative intensity(height) range of '0.1-1.0' in at least one sample (relative to the feature with the highest intensity(height) in the sample).
Molecular features were filtered and only retained if they were inside the relative area range of '0.1-1.0' in at least one sample (relative to the feature with the highest area in the sample).
MS/MS spectra of all molecular features with more than '5' fragment ions were compared pairwise and scored using the 'modified cosine' algorithm, with a fragment tolerance of '0.1'. From the resulting similarity matrix, a network was created, with features represented as nodes and the similarity value as edges. Edges were pruned if their score was below a similarity cutoff of '0.7'. Also, edges were pruned so that only the '10' highest scoring edges remained.
MS/MS spectra of all molecular features with more than '5' fragment ions were compared pairwise and scored using the 'MS2Deepscore' algorithm. From the resulting similarity matrix, a network was created, with features represented as nodes and the similarity value as edges. Edges were pruned if their score was below a similarity cutoff of '0.8'. Also, edges were pruned so that only the '10' highest scoring edges remained.
