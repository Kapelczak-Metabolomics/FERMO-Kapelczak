### Overview

- "FERMO takes very long to process my files. Did it crash?"

For large peaktables, FERMO can calculate a long time, since all calculations are performed on the local computer. One way of checking if FERMO has crashed is to check the command line window that is opened when FERMO is started. The log messages can give an idea if the application is still running or has crashed. If FERMO crashed unexpectedly, please feel free to open an issue on our Github page. 

- "I would like to have a certain functionality which is missing in FERMO. What should I do?"

FERMO is still under active development. If you are missing a particular functionality, please feel free to open an issue, make a pull request, or contact the authors. We are happy to receive feedback.
